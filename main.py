ID: 2409.12532, Title: Denoising Reuse: Exploiting Inter-frame Motion Consistency for Efficient Video Latent Generation, Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.12532, Abstract: Abstract: Video generation using diffusion-based models is constrained by high computational costs due to the frame-wise iterative diffusion process. This work presents a Diffusion Reuse MOtion (Dr. Mo) network to accelerate latent video generation. Our key discovery is that coarse-grained noises in earlier denoising steps have demonstrated high motion consistency across consecutive video frames. Following this observation, Dr. Mo propagates those coarse-grained noises onto the next frame by incorporating carefully designed, lightweight inter-frame motions, eliminating massive computational redundancy in frame-wise diffusion models. The more sensitive and fine-grained noises are still acquired via later denoising steps, which can be essential to retain visual qualities. As such, deciding which intermediate steps should switch from motion-based propagations to denoising can be a crucial problem and a key tradeoff between efficiency and quality. Dr. Mo employs a meta-network named Denoising Step Selector (DSS) to dynamically determine desirable intermediate steps across video frames. Extensive evaluations on video generation and editing tasks have shown that Dr. Mo can substantially accelerate diffusion models in video tasks with improved visual qualities.

Today, I completed the final revisions on our research paper, "Denoising Reuse: Exploiting Inter-frame Motion Consistency for Efficient Video Latent Generation." It feels rewarding to see our ideas come together and to prepare to share our findings with the broader community.

As we dove into the complexities of video generation using diffusion-based models, we encountered the significant challenge of high computational costs due to the iterative diffusion process for each frame. After extensive experimentation, we developed the Diffusion Reuse MOtion (Dr. Mo) network. One of our most exciting discoveries was the observation that coarse-grained noises from earlier denoising steps maintained a remarkable level of motion consistency across consecutive frames.

With this in mind, we designed Dr. Mo to propagate these coarse-grained noises to subsequent frames by utilizing carefully crafted inter-frame motions. This innovation significantly reduces the computational load, addressing a major bottleneck in traditional frame-wise diffusion models.

However, we recognized the importance of fine-grained noises for preserving visual quality, which are captured during the later denoising steps. Striking a balance between when to switch from motion-based propagation to denoising became a crucial aspect of our work. To tackle this, we implemented a meta-network, the Denoising Step Selector (DSS), to dynamically select the most effective intermediate steps.

After conducting extensive evaluations on video generation and editing tasks, it was thrilling to see that Dr. Mo not only accelerated diffusion models but also improved visual quality. I can't wait to see how the community responds to our work; I genuinely feel proud of what we have accomplished!
